This project based workshop will go through the entire Physical Design ASIC flow using OpenLane by eFabless and SKY130 PDK by Google/Skywater. This workshop is hosted by VLSI System Design (VSD). The entire flow will be described using detailed descriptions and related screesnhots showing the results that were achieved at the end of each step. All the mentioned steps were run using the OpenLane flow and using various open source EDA tools.
